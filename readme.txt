This is the WPF solution I have created for this task. This is an area I have more knowledge in, however I think the skills I've use are
transferrable to any kind of applications. I have included two php files alongside this. These are files that sit on my own server, I used
these to connect and run queries against my database, using web requests inside C#. This allows for safe and secure connections over the 
web.

I have also sent a link to the web application I started, however I didn't get too far with it. I understand the basic logic and ideals 
of MVC however implementing it is something that I haven't had much experience in, as we didn't cover it at university.

Thanks, Oliver.
